## LATENT: web OAuth callback silently discards a custom-scheme `return`, falling back to `/`

**Severity:** latent. No shipped client currently exercises this path — see
"Why this is not urgent" below. Filed so it is not rediscovered from scratch.

`internal/server/handlers/oauth_login.go:145` picks the post-login destination:

```go
dest := "/"
if payload.Return != "" { dest = payload.Return }
http.Redirect(c.Writer, c.Request, dest, http.StatusFound)
```

`payload.Return` was set at `Start` via `sanitizeReturn(c.Query("return"))`, and
`sanitizeReturn` requires a single leading slash:

```go
if ret == "" || !strings.HasPrefix(ret, "/") { return "" }
```

So a native-app deep link such as `audiobooth://oauth` becomes `""`, `dest`
falls back to `"/"`, and the caller is sent to the web SPA root. **No error is
raised and nothing is logged** — the redirect target is simply replaced. A client
expecting to be handed back to its own URL scheme instead lands on the web UI,
which surfaces as an opaque "it logged me into the website" rather than as a
failure.

### Why this is not urgent

Production logs over 7 days show **zero** requests to `/auth/oauth/*` — the web
provider flow is reached only by the SPA's login buttons, which legitimately want
same-site paths. Audiobookshelf clients use `/auth/openid` +
`/auth/openid/callback` (`internal/server/handlers/abs/openid.go`) instead, and
that path already handles custom schemes correctly via `oidcRedirectAllowed` and
`oidcRedirect`.

This was misdiagnosed on 2026-08-01 as the cause of the AudioBooth login failure.
It was not — the real cause was Cloudflare Access intercepting
`/auth/openid/callback` before it reached the origin, fixed with a scoped Access
bypass on that single path. Recording the distinction here so the next
investigation does not repeat it: **a redirect-to-web-root symptom has two
plausible causes, and only traffic logs distinguish them.**

### Fix, if a client ever needs it

Do **not** loosen `sanitizeReturn` — it is the open-redirect guard and the reason
`d87cbf37` (account takeover via unregistered `redirect_uri`) cannot recur here.

Instead mirror the ABS path: on an allowlisted deep link, mint a single-use
PKCE-bound code via the `abs` package's existing code store and 302 to
`audiobooth://oauth?code=…&state=…`, letting the client redeem it at the existing
`/auth/openid/callback`. Two constraints that a naive implementation gets wrong:

1. **Gate on `redirect_uri` AND `code_challenge` together.**
   `/auth/oauth/:provider/start` is the unauthenticated web login endpoint; if a
   bare `redirect_uri` could trigger a 400, anyone could break web login by
   appending a query param to a link.
2. **There are two distinct PKCE exchanges** — server↔IdP (verifier already in
   `StatePayload.Verifier`) and app↔server (the app's own challenge). Conflating
   them either breaks the upstream token exchange or issues codes with no
   app-side proof of possession.

Unverified assumption to settle before building: whether
`ASWebAuthenticationSession` returns the `SameSite=Lax` `oauth_state` cookie on
the hop back from the IdP. If it does not, `Callback` dies at
`oauth_state_missing` regardless. Only a real-device test can answer it.
