- [ ] **`isAudiobookITL` under-classifies audiobooks (fail-safe, but fix carefully).**
  P0 cross-type census (§F5) found it misses `Audio Book`/`audio book` (it checks the
  substring `"audiobook"` with NO space — 705 tracks on prod) and every literary-genre
  audiobook (Science Fiction, Fantasy, Suspense, Comedy, …) — 3,436 AO-owned audiobooks
  total classified non-audiobook. Impact: for `GuardRebuildTarget` this is FAIL-SAFE
  (inflates the non-audiobook count → guard more likely to block), so no urgent safety bug.
  But: (a) never use `isAudiobookITL` as a relocate/cleanup targeting filter; (b) if fixing
  the heuristic (add the space variant, broaden genres), it LOWERS the non-audiobook count
  and could drop a real library below `GuardRebuildTarget`'s "looks real" threshold — so
  re-derive those thresholds in the SAME PR and re-test the guard. See
  `internal/itunes/library_shape.go:35` + `docs/specs/2026-07-23-itunes-2way-p0-findings.md` §F5.
