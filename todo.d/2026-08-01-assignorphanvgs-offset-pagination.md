## BUG: `AssignOrphanVGs` can silently skip books — offset pagination over an async memdb snapshot

**Severity:** correctness bug in a full-library maintenance op. Surfaces as a CI
flake, but the same defect skips real books in production.

`internal/reconcile/reconcile.go:1292` enumerates with offset arithmetic:

```go
for offset := 0; ; offset += pageSize {
    books, err := store.GetAllBooksCore(pageSize, offset)
```

and `GetAllBooksCore` (`internal/database/pebble_store.go:439`) reads **memdb**
when `UseMemDB` is set:

```go
if p.UseMemDB && p.mem() != nil {
    return p.mem().GetAllBooksCore(limit, offset, nil)
}
```

The memdb snapshot is republished **asynchronously** (`memdb warmup starting
(async)` → `memdb warmup published`). Offset pagination is only sound over a
stable collection: if the snapshot is swapped between page N and page N+1, the
offset no longer refers to the same position and rows are skipped or repeated.

**Observed**, CI run 30702594886, `TestAssignOrphanVGs_RealStoreConcurrent`:

```
reconcile_orphanvg_test.go:213: Assigned = 39, want 40
reconcile_orphanvg_test.go:226: book 01KYYSX09WES7849SHVVBN8H4N VersionGroupID not set
... assign-orphan-vgs summary total_checked=39 assigned=39 skipped=0 errors=0
```

`total_checked=39` for 40 books is the tell: the book was never **enumerated**,
so this is not a write race or a lost update — the op simply never saw it. It
therefore reports success while having skipped work, which is the dangerous
shape: no error, no retry, no signal.

Does not reproduce locally (5/5 passes) — it needs the scheduling pressure of a
loaded CI runner to land the snapshot swap mid-iteration.

**Fix:** enumerate with `ListBookIDs` + `registry.RunItems` rather than
offset-paging a mutable snapshot. This is the pattern the repo already mandates
for full-library jobs, for exactly this reason — see
[[feedback_getallbooksfrom_memdb_cap]] ("cursor pagination silently capped at
2×limit on prod memdb path", fixed in #1647) and the concurrency section of
CLAUDE.md. An ID list is a stable set; paging positions in a snapshot that can
be replaced underneath you is not.

**Also worth auditing:** every other `GetAllBooksCore(pageSize, offset)` caller
that walks the whole library has the same exposure. Grep for the offset-loop
shape before assuming this is the only one.
