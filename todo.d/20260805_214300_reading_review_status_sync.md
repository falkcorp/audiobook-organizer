- [ ] **Reading status and review/rating must sync from the app back to the
  server** — owner request 2026-08-05: set it in the app, it persists server-side.
  Mirror how Audiobookshelf does it rather than inventing a shape.

  Two distinct things:
  - **Reading status** — not-started / in-progress / finished, plus the
    finished-at timestamp. ABS models this as `isFinished` + `finishedAt` on the
    media-progress record, and clients set it both explicitly ("mark finished")
    and implicitly (progress crossing a completion threshold).
  - **Review status** — the user's own rating and/or written review. ABS core
    does NOT have a first-class review object, so check what the iOS clients
    actually send before designing; this may need to be our own field exposed in
    a way clients tolerate.

  Prior art in-repo: Phase 6 ABS progress writes already landed (6 endpoints,
  `hideFromContinueListening` PATCH persistence, bookmarks — PR #2102), and
  `remove-from-continue-listening` was fixed in #2116. Reading status likely
  belongs alongside that media-progress work rather than as a new subsystem —
  look there first.

  Verify against real clients, not just the spec: AudioBooth and Absorb differ in
  which endpoints they call and when. The conformance harness checks field
  presence and type, which is what catches a client silently ignoring a field we
  thought we were sending.

  ⚠️ Round-trip matters more than write-once here. A finished flag that persists
  but never comes back on the next sync reads to the user as data loss, and it is
  the kind of bug that only shows up after reinstalling the app.
