- [ ] **Canary the multidisc applies behind a before/after snapshot** — owner
  item 3 (2026-08-05). 138 pending `regroup.multidisc` holds; running them
  requires flipping `review_apply_enabled`, which is OFF in prod.

  🔴 **SNAPSHOT TO A FILE ON DISK BEFORE FLIPPING THE FLAG.** Capture, per
  candidate: every member book ID, title, duration, file path, and which ID
  `pickPrimary` will select (smallest ULID —
  `internal/plugins/maintenance/regroup_apply.go`). The apply path **hard-deletes
  absorbed rows**, so post-hoc reconstruction is impossible; the on-disk snapshot
  is the only record.

  That snapshot is not theoretical caution: it is what caught **41 of 43**
  "confident" multidisc candidates that would have merged distinct novels into
  single books. Do not skip it because the classifier looks better now.

  🔴 **Approve by explicit `ids:[...]`, never kind-scoped.** The frontend's
  `handleBulkAction(kind, 'approve')` approves EVERY pending item of a kind — one
  click with the flag on fires 138 `CombineBooks` calls. Start with a handful of
  groups verifiable by ear, diff the snapshot, then widen.

  Note a separate finding worth checking first: a 2026-08-05 measurement found
  **9 of 138** multidisc holds have members that are individually book-length,
  meaning the series-guard would fire on them if it were evaluated. The guard
  only applies to the flat branch — the disc and chapter/edition branches do not
  check it. Those 9 are near-misses still sitting in the queue.

  Depends on [[review-queue-recommendations-and-overrides]] (per-item action
  selection) so approval targets one hold at a time.
