- [ ] **ABS-SYNC TASK-12 (P1, data-loss class): close the three identity gaps so §4.3's
  ID-durability claim is actually true.** Owner decided (2026-07-30) to hook **all three**
  paths, not just the worst one. Today only `merge.Service.MergeBooks` repoints sync IDs;
  these three still orphan a device's listening position:
  1. **`dedup.MergeBooks`** (`internal/dedup/book_dedup.go:395`) — a separate, still-live
     path used by `internal/reconcile/itunes_heal.go` that **HARD-DELETES**. An
     unrepointed sync ID here is unrecoverable: there is no surviving row to repoint later.
  2. **`CombineBooks`** — same file as the hooked merge, unhooked.
  3. **Untagged move** — `internal/scanner/scanner.go` (~2078-2099) mints a fresh Book
     ULID via `CreateBook` + version-link and never calls `RepointSyncItem`.
  Primitives already exist and are merged (`RepointSyncItem` in #2070,
  `RepointSyncFile` in #2068). Note `internal/merge/serialize.go` already provides a
  process-wide `mergeSerializeMu`, so no extra book-ID partitioning is needed — run
  inside that existing critical section. Requires a `-race` test exercising concurrent
  merges (`MergeBooks` has a prior race history in this repo).
