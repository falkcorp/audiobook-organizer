## UNSPECIFIED: play counts and listening history have no designed ABS surface

Raised while building the Phase 6 write half (2026-08-02). The owner's goal statement
names "play counts" as one of "all the backend features the application expects."
**The design spec defines no endpoint for them**, so nothing was invented — this
records the gap rather than guessing at a shape.

### What exists today

- `UserBookState.TotalListenedSeconds` accumulates per (user, book) and is written by
  the ABS sync path.
- `IncrementBookPlayStats` / `IncrementUserListenStats` /
  `GetBookStats` / `GetUserStats` exist in `pebble_store_playback.go` but are **not**
  wired to the ABS surface.
- `Book.ITunesPlayCount` is an imported scalar from iTunes, unrelated to listening
  recorded by this server.

### What real ABS exposes (and why we currently 404 it deliberately)

`GET /api/me/listening-stats` and `GET /api/me/item/listening-sessions/:id` are the
surfaces a client asks for. Both are **intentionally 404** today per spec §1.8.6: they
carry ~12 non-optional fields, callers wrap them in `try?`, and a half-correct body is
worse than none. AudioBooth polled `/api/me/listening-stats` 7 times in the 2026-08-01
window and tolerated every 404 without user-visible breakage.

### Decision needed before building

1. Is a play *count* even the right primitive here, or is `TotalListenedSeconds`
   (already recorded) what the owner actually wants surfaced?
2. If the ABS-shaped endpoints are to be implemented, all ~12 fields must be produced —
   a partial body is a regression from the current honest 404.
3. `POST /api/session/local[-all]` (offline replay) is the other half of an honest
   listening history and is itself unbuilt; `progress.MergeOfflineReplay` exists and is
   tested but has no HTTP caller.

**Do not implement piecemeal.** Half a stats surface reads to a client as a broken
server rather than an absent feature.
