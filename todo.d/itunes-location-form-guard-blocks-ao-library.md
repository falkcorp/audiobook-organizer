- [ ] **🚧 P2 BLOCKER — location-form guard rejects the entire live AO library (F7).** The
  `location-form` safety guard (`internal/itunes/itl_safety_contract.go:562`) rejects any
  `SafeWriteITL` when a track's 0x0D/0x0B contains `.itunes-writeback/`. On the live AO
  library that is **82,976 tracks** — because the AO library physically lives at
  `W:\audiobook-organizer\.itunes-writeback\` so its iTunes media folder legitimately is
  `…\.itunes-writeback\iTunes Media\`. The guard was built to catch a staging path leaking
  into the hands-off Original library (damaged-4); in the hard-cutover design (iTunes pointed
  AT the AO library) the substring is correct and unavoidable. Result: the P2 relocate op
  **cannot write the library at all** (`Force` does not override location-form — only the
  bounded-delta guard). FIX (owner decision): (1, preferred) scope the staging-marker check to
  the write TARGET using the P0 4-state `LibrarySet` mode facts — reject `.itunes-writeback/`
  only when writing the Original library, or only when the path's `.itunes-writeback/` root
  differs from the AO library's own root; or (2) physically move the AO library + media out
  from under a `.itunes-writeback/` dir (invasive). Reproduced by
  `TestITLRelocateContractStatus` (env-gated). See
  `docs/specs/2026-07-23-itunes-2way-p0-findings.md` §F7.
