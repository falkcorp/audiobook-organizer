- [ ] **TODO-SEC-BIND** The service binds every interface
      (`ExecStart=… serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8484`), so anything on the LAN
      reaches the origin directly and **Cloudflare Access is not a boundary** —
      the edge is only enforced for traffic that arrives through the tunnel.
      Bind loopback (or the tunnel-facing interface only) in
      `deploy/local.conf` so Access becomes the single front door, then verify
      the tunnel still serves `books.jdfalk.com`. Note in the PR that
      direct-to-LAN verification is no longer possible **by design** after this.
      The tunnel connector runs on rpi1-3, not on the origin host, so the
      loopback bind must account for that hop.

- [ ] **TODO-SEC-JWT** Rotate `ABS_JWT_SECRET` — it was pasted in plaintext into
      a chat transcript on 2026-07-31. It signs every ABS session token. Rotate
      it in `deploy/local.conf` (gitignored — never commit or print it; redact
      with `sed -E 's/(SECRET|TOKEN|KEY)=[^ ]*/\1=<redacted>/g'` when dumping a
      unit), redeploy, and confirm previously-issued tokens are rejected.

- [ ] **TODO-SEC-SYSTEMD** The unit has `User=audiobook`, `NoNewPrivileges`,
      `ProtectKernelTunables`, `ProtectControlGroups` and `PrivateTmp`, but no
      `ProtectSystem=strict`, no `ReadWritePaths`, no `CapabilityBoundingSet`,
      no `SystemCallFilter` and **no egress restriction**. `IPAddressDeny=any`
      plus a narrow allowlist is what stops a compromised process reaching the
      rest of the LAN. It needs the Whisper host on `:19847` and Ollama on
      `:11434`, plus outbound HTTPS for OpenLibrary/AcoustID — an over-tight
      rule silently breaks metadata and transcription, so test before claiming
      it works.
