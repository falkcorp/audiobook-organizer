- [ ] **Per-file intro transcription as the primary book-identity signal** — owner
  design 2026-08-06. Storage and the first-file sort fix are **DONE** (PRs #2168);
  the parser, the tiered backfill, and the wiring are open.

  **The idea.** An audiobook opens with a spoken *"&lt;Title&gt; by &lt;Author&gt;, read by
  &lt;Narrator&gt;"* announcement. That announcement marks a book **start**. A file
  without one is a continuation. That is direct identity evidence, where the
  current classifier only has runtime — a proxy.

  **Why it needed per-file storage.** Transcripts lived on `Book`, so only ONE
  file's opening was ever captured and "12 files that are one book" was
  indistinguishable from "12 files that are 12 books". Measured on prod, one
  folder's files read:

  ```
  file 1: "This is a reading of Overlord, Book 7. This part includes the prologue and Chapter 1."
  file 2: "This is a reading of Overlord Volume 7. This part includes Chapter 2."
  file 3: "Hello... This is Overlord Volume 7, Chapter 3."
  ```

  Per-file that sequence is proof of continuation; per-book it is invisible. It
  also explains the measured **45.8%** credit-parse rate across 1,476 review-queue
  members — the op sampled one arbitrary file per book.

  ### Remaining work

  - [ ] **Three-outcome parser.** `ParseAudiobookIntro` splits on the first
        standalone `"by"` and returns credits-or-nothing. Confirmed prod false
        positives: a book in a *Girls with Rebel Souls* folder parsed as
        `"Meet Me in Paradise / Libby Hubscher"`, and prose *"...he wasn't mildly
        amused by Memphis fortunes"* parsed as TITLE/AUTHOR. Must distinguish
        **book-opening credits** / **chapter announcement** (*"This part includes
        Chapter 2"*, *"Welcome to X Audio Books"*) / **prose**. Per-file storage
        unlocks the discriminator that fixes this: **position** — a real opening
        is at track 1, prose-containing-"by" is at any track. That is why the
        disc-aware sort fix (#2168) was a prerequisite and not cleanup.
  - [ ] **Tiered backfill.** Naive "every file" is ~284,000 files ≈ 12–14 days of
        GPU. Tiers: **0** single-file books migrate by copy (zero GPU, ~32,600
        books); **1** assembled multi-file books probe the first 3 files only;
        **1b** escalate to the full set if all 3 carry credits — which is what
        makes the cheap tier *safe*, since it cannot silently be wrong; **2**
        bookless/shattered/queue members get every file; **3** a lazy, indefinite
        full sweep so every file eventually has a transcript.
  - [ ] **Wire into the regroup classifier**, outranking runtime where both exist.
        Validate by diffing against the 356 holds already measured under the
        runtime rule.
  - [ ] **Wire into First Aid** as a tier-2 signal beside the duration probe, and
        let the verdict pick the fixer.

  ### Measured facts worth keeping

  - 72.7% of books are single-file; 11.3% have 21+ files and hold most of the
    317,054 rows. The signal is precisely targeted at the fraction that is
    actually ambiguous.
  - **195 of 204** "untranscribed" review-queue members have ZERO `book_file`
    rows — unlinked, not un-transcribed. **Relink before transcribing** or they
    need a second pass. [[first-aid-library-validate-repair]]'s probe already
    found 434 of 1,019 directory-shaped books confidently linkable.
  - The WAV clip cache is keyed by **file path**, so clips already extracted
    survive the per-file move and ffmpeg is skipped on re-run.
  - Book-level transcription is already **saturated** — a full `only_missing` run
    over 221 pages transcribed 0 books. There is no warm-up value left; the
    per-file pass is the entire remaining work.

  🔴 **Absent transcript means "cannot verify", never "continuation".** This
  codebase has now been bitten by absent-value-read-as-evidence four separate
  ways: `DurationSec == 0` read as "short" (disabled the series guard across 97.5%
  of the queue), a 404 body read as "zero files", `memPtr == nil` read as "nothing
  to do" (silently dropped writes for the process lifetime), and an empty
  `intro_transcription` read as "needs transcribing" when it meant "has no file".
