## DATA: BookFile rows are duplicated 2× AND their durations are milliseconds, not seconds

Found 2026-08-02 while chasing why the app showed **Hyperion at "0%, 48h 31m
remaining"** on its Continue Listening shelf. Two independent defects compound, and
either alone corrupts every duration-derived number on the ABS surface.

### Measured, on `01KNDBK4MM369VJXA1QKQ6YR8S` ("Hyperion")

```
total BookFile rows: 298
distinct tracks:     149   | tracks with >1 row: 148
duplication factor:  2.00x

duration min=521  max=1803755
rows >50000 (impossible as SECONDS for one track — that is >13h): 297 of 298
sum as-is       = 41276.8 h      <- what the code computes today
sum if ms       =    41.3 h
halved + ms     =    20.6 h      <- Hyperion's actual length ✓
```

### Defect 1 — every track has two BookFile rows

One from the organized tree, one from the iTunes tree:

```
464039s track=1  data/books/audiobook-organizer/Dan Simmons/Hyperion/Hyperion
464065s track=1  /iTunes Media/Audiobooks/Dan Simmons/01 Hyperion 001-149.mp3
```

The pair's durations differ by ~26 ms, so they are the same audio measured twice —
not two genuine files.

### Defect 2 — durations are stored in milliseconds

`BookFile.Duration` is **seconds** by contract: the committed oracle fixture uses
`Duration: 9975` for a 9975-second book, and `seedOracleLibrary` uses `1662` for
~27-minute tracks. But 297 of these 298 rows are 6–7 digit values that only make
sense as ms. Track 144 is the smoking gun — it carries **both** forms:

```
521534s   track=144   (milliseconds)
   521s   track=144   (seconds — same value, correct unit)
```

### Why it matters

`durationFor` (`abs/userdata.go`) and the mapper both sum `BookFile.Duration` as
seconds, and §5b makes that sum the ONE authoritative duration for `media.duration`,
the play session, `startOffset`, synthesized chapters, and the progress fraction. With
a ~2000× inflated denominator, `currentTime / duration` rounds to zero — which is
exactly the reported **"0%"** — and the remaining-time readout is nonsense.

### Scope is UNKNOWN — measure before fixing

Confirmed for this one book. Whether it is iTunes-import-specific or library-wide is
**not** established, and that decides the size of the job:

```bash
# per book: row count vs distinct track count, and how many durations look like ms
curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABK" \
  "https://127.0.0.1:8484/api/v1/audiobooks/<id>/files"
```

### Do not fix blind

- Deduping BookFile rows is a **destructive prod mutation** — it needs a dry-run and
  an explicit decision, and it interacts with the dedup subsystem and with
  `books/itunes/**` being HANDS-OFF.
- A units migration must be **idempotent and detectable**: track 144 proves both units
  already coexist, so a blanket `/1000` would corrupt the rows that are already
  correct. Any repair has to classify per row, not per book.
- Fixing units without deduping (or vice versa) leaves the duration wrong by 2×,
  which is still enough to misplace every chapter boundary.
