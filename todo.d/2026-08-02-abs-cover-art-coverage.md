## GAP: only ~19.5% of books have cover art, so most ABS clients show placeholders

**Severity:** cosmetic but pervasive. Not a code defect — `GET /api/items/:id/cover`
behaves as designed.

Observed 2026-08-02: AudioBooth's library grid rendered, and every cover request in
the sample 404'd:

```
GET /api/items/cb6e44f7-…/cover  → 404
GET /api/items/7840afbd-…/cover  → 404      (5 of 5 in the window)
```

On prod, `/mnt/bigdata/books/audiobook-organizer/covers/` holds **7,885** files
against a library of roughly **40,400** books — about **19.5%** coverage.

### Why this is not a bug

`Handler.ItemCover` resolves via `metadata.CoverPathForBook`, which globs
`<RootDir>/covers/<bookID>.{jpg,jpeg,png,webp,gif}` and returns `""` when nothing
matches. The handler then answers 404, and its own comment records that as intended:
*"A 404 here is correct and harmless: both clients fall back to a placeholder."*

**Not yet confirmed:** whether those 5 specific items lack cover files, or whether the
sync-UUID → Book-ULID resolution is picking the wrong ID. With 19.5% coverage, 5
consecutive misses has a ~34% chance of being pure luck, so this is *likely* a data
gap but has NOT been proven. Verify by resolving one of those sync IDs to its Book
ULID and checking for `covers/<ULID>.*` before investing in a backfill — a mapping bug
and an empty directory look identical from the client.

### If it is the data gap

A cover backfill over ~32,500 books is a full-library maintenance op and must be
written to the repo's concurrency rules from the start (CLAUDE.md): bounded worker
pool, `registry.RunItems`, never a plain `for range books`. Network-bound if it
fetches from a metadata provider, so size concurrency to that provider's rate limits
rather than `runtime.NumCPU()`.

Look for an existing parallel sibling before writing a new loop — the acoustid
backfill (`internal/plugins/acoustid/backfill.go`) is the established pattern.
